# Portfolio-Samuel-Leite
First Portfolio for my projects to be deposited later on

This project was to demonstrate CSS skills in building a portfolio in HTML format,
one that has listed all previously worked on projects. At the time of the posting of this project, there 
was only 1 other project to reference, so the other 4 are references to my future possible projects that have to 
do with spices, they all lead to a "under construction" page at the time of this posting, implying that there will be
additions in the near future
