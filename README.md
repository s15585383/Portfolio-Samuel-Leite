# Portfolio-Samuel-Leite
First Portfolio for my projects to be deposited later on

This project was to demonstrate CSS skills in building a portfolio in HTML format,
one that has listed all previously worked on projects. At the time of the posting of this project, there 
was only 1 other project to reference, so the other 4 are references to my future possible projects that have to 
do with spices, they all lead to a "under construction" page at the time of this posting, implying that there will be
additions in the near future

User story:
## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
acceptance criteria:
## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
